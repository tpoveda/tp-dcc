============================================================

DCC agnostic framework that allows to improve the experience when using DCCs.

Easy to setup framework that contains lot of utility functions and classes to streamline the creation of new DCC tools for TDs.
Also, the framework features a collection of tools that can be helpful for different departments.



* Reroute DCC agnostic layer
* Generic DCC objects
* Inheritance based configuration files system. Your tools can use different configurations based on which DCC you are working on.
* Generic DCC agnostic TCP client/server implementation. Launch your tool outisde your DCC.
* Huge collection of Python related utils modules: string management, file IO, etc.
* Huge collection of Qt widgets. Your tools will look similar no matter which DCC are your workign on.
* Complete Qt style/theme manager.
* DCC agnostic Python based unit test framework.
* And much more ...

Requirements
============================================================

* Make sure **Python 3.X** is installed in your machine.

    .. note::
        Scripts expect to find Python executables in their default locations:
            * **Python 3**: C:\Python3X

        You can edit **setup_venv_py.bat** if you want to use custom Python installation directory.

* Make sure **virtualenv** is installed:

      .. code-block::

            pip install virtualenv


* Make sure **Git** client is installed : https://git-scm.com/


How to use
============================================================

1. Run **setup_venv_py.bat**: to create virtual environment for Python 3.

2. Execute **tp_dcc_main.py** in your favorite Python DCC editor to load tp-dcc framework.
